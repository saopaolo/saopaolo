Ad Tech Ops | Web & Software Dev | AI Integrations | Cloud Security
I bridge the gap between complex advertising ecosystems and scalable website and software engineering. My focus is on building secure, AI-driven applications that optimise performance and protect data integrity.

🚀 What I'm Working On
Smart Ad-Yield Engines: Building ML models to predict floor prices and optimize revenue in real-time.
Secure AI Wrappers: Developing private, enterprise-grade AI interfaces with a focus on data sanitization.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Securing cloud deployments using Terraform and automated security scanning.
