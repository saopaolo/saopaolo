- 👋 Hi, I’m @saopaolo, a jack of many technical trades, master of none.  Nowadays mostly known as a T shaped technical project director.
- 👀 I started my career as a software developer and then moved on to search, digital marketing, web analytics, data science, etc.  I intend to always be a student of technology and software development, hence I'm constantly trying to break things and make them better.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on how ReactJS can be stretched to improved the IOT experience, specifically blending with old school ecommerce and CMS (WordPress) and new technologies (APIs of all shapes and sizes, web 3.0, decentralisation, etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like minds and startups that potentially improve the way we live.
